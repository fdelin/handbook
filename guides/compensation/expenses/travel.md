# Travel Expenses

If you incur travel expenses as part of your work at Made Tech, the business will reimburse your standard class travel costs.

Some examples of work travel you can expense:

- Public transport / taxi to a client site for a meeting
- Taxi home after working late
- Travelling to work at a client site outside of the region of your Made Tech office


## Using your own car
You can use your private car where you cannot or it's not practical to use public transportation to travel for business. The current reimbursement rate as prescribed by HMRC is 45p per mile (up to 10k miles).

When claiming your mileage, please use a journey planner such as Google Maps to get the round-trip distance and include a screenshot when expensing. 

To allow MadeTech to claim the VAT on the journeyâ€™s fuel element, please can you provide the following:
- A petrol receipt (showing VAT) dated max 2 months before the journey.
- Add to the expense description the engine size of the car and if it's petrol or diesel.

This part is optional and the expense total should always be miles*applicable reimbursement rate.

If using your own car, you must ensure that adequate insurance and breakdown cover is in place. MadeTech will not assume any responsibility for breakdowns, fines, accidents or any damage. If unsure of any of the above, please contact Finance for additional guidance.


## Travel that is not covered

Where you're employed as a staff member in a Made Tech office, your regular travel to that office or to a client site within that metropolitan area is not be covered.

For example: if you're employed in the London office, and were working two days per week on-site with a client in Westminster, your travel from home to either the London office, or the Westminster client site is not covered.
